factory planner notes

each file like class
cause they have similar functions inside them
some have more and others less
a function is a small program that we call and it does the things inside it 
example it can just print stuff (example functions)


instructions:
we start with draw function (exists in every file we use)
then we just write a lot of text for information like what satisfactory is and how to use this program

then we get to more interesting stuff
first we have this position and dimensions things that look like functions
they are not well kinda yes but the are named tuples
those are created with function we get from collections
it takes 2 parameters (name, value)
and return a thing that can be called elsewhere
and for value we can enter example x and y and just use like position.x and dimensions.width

then even more interesting thing is class Button
if we want to create a object with class we need contructor and here we use __init__ (initialize)
and inside there we assign things to self which is the class object and those values can be used elsewhere
and inside methods for that object
methods are just a specific ways to do something like __init__ is method and every class here has
but they do different things

to use variables assigned to self(this object) we need to pass this self into each method where we assign or use stuff
also all the classes here have this check_click or onclick and that just checks if user clicked on this object 
and does the things we want to happen on the onclick

return to instructions 
we can also use those variables set for the object outside the class code
like here button_next.draw()

we have set the functions we call on the onclick on the making of interactions


T.TRACER

why is this faster
turtle does only 1 process which is making the information and data and not drawing
since normally half of the process is data and other half drawing 


IMPORTING

with just import gets the hole file so anything in there can be used
with from somewhere import something
it checks the scope of the import so indent if you import 1 function from there and have imports around it
it will import those as well since they were in the same scope
